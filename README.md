# SimpleNotesApp
This is a repo for the Keemoji test task.

Create a simple notes app

The app should have the following features:

1. Add a new note
2. View existing notes
3. Edit a note
4. Delete a note

A note cannot be empty.
 
Bonus task:

Add ability to take a photo or video (without launching external apps with startActivityForResult) and attach it to a note. For this purpose you can use, for instance, CameraX library.


The code should be covered with unit tests.
For storing notes you can pick any persistence library.
The task should be done using Kotlin programming language with MVP or MVVM architecture. For dependency injection you should use Dagger2.
